Out of the blue I took a beginning sculpture class at City College. And happened to come upon an Art Department flyer about animation class VMD 162. VMD 105 is one of the prerequisite classes for VMD 162. So here I am. That said, I do enjoy this class. I am a PC person. I do appreciate the chance to experience first hand the edge Mac has over PC in the graphic design area.

I went to the Grand Canyon but did not take a selfie. Thus the idea for this fantasy selfie was born. I add a giant crab seemingly climbed out of the Colorado River. To imply the ensuring chaos, I painted on roughened edges and water splash marks.

This Illustrator project would be sourced for the following Animate project. Therefore, I decided to use the same character I drew for a flip book assignment from DSGN 101. Having visual reference of movement saved me a lot of time in completing the Animate project.

Animate project is my favorite. Not that I am satisfied with the outcome. For I ran into many brick walls.  Failure is the mother of success. I have confidence that I could utilize Adobe Animateâ€™s full potential in the future.
